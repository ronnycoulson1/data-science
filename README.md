# 🧠 Data Science

A collection of data science projects exploring data analysis, visualization, and machine learning using **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and more.  
Each folder represents a standalone project where I apply concepts from data cleaning to visualization and interpretation.

## 🧩 Project Milestones

### 1️⃣ Chronic Disease Analysis (CDC Dataset)
**Goal:** Perform data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualize causes of chronic diseases across U.S. states.

**Highlights:**
- Loaded and cleaned 300K+ rows of public health data  
- Explored missing values and inconsistencies  
- Analyzed causes (e.g., Arthritis, Diabetes, Mental Health)  
- Created bar charts for top causes and average health indicators  
- Structured the project into clear milestones (data prep → EDA → visualization → reporting)

**Tools:** Pandas, Matplotlib, JupyterLab

## 🎯 Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a **learning and portfolio space** for my journey in data science and AI engineering.  
Each project reflects hands-on experience applying theoretical concepts to real-world datasets.

> My focus is on understanding **why** data behaves a certain way and how to communicate insights visually and effectively.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

- 🧮 Add predictive modeling with Scikit-learn  
- 🗂️ Integrate SQL and APIs for real-time data  
- 📊 Build dashboards using Plotly and Streamlit  
- 🤖 Explore advanced machine learning & deep learning frameworks  
- 📈 Expand to financial and algorithmic trading datasets
