# 🧠 Data Science

A collection of data science projects exploring data analysis, visualization, and machine learning using **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and more.  
Each folder represents a standalone project where I apply concepts from data cleaning to visualization and interpretation.
